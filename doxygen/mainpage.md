Modus Create's Genus Holiday Game {#mainpage}
=============

Genus (‘a class, kind, or group marked by common characteristics or by one common characteristic’) is a puzzle game where the player must match three or more similar shapes, colors or patterns in a row or column to gain points and eliminate items on the playfield.

Two components make up the Genus game. [Creative Engine](https://github.com/ModusCreateOrg/creative-engine) is a foundation that abstracts platform details and implements efficient algorithms for building games. The [Genus](https://github.com/ModusCreateOrg/genus) game implementation built on the engine is the second.

This documentation is a reference for the code in Genus and Creative Engine.
