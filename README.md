Genus is a cross-platform a puzzle game created by [Modus Create](https://moduscreate.com) for the 2018 holiday sesaon. Genus runs on the [ODROID GO](https://www.hardkernel.com/shop/odroid-go/), macOS and Linux.

## How to Play
Genus is a simple puzzle game where the objective is to match colors in 2x2 patterns. Once a 2x2 pattern is found, the blocks will be darken as they are marked for clearing. A bonus timer will appear. As the timer runs out, you can create additional color matches. Themore matches you create, the higher your score will be.  Play until you run out of spaces to place new blocks.
